# Table2Vec
This a project to create a vector representation of a raw html table. Web tables contain rich information, however, 
there is still no reliable way of using them as generic sources of information.
The current version, creates a vector representation of a table given the input html source code of it. It is imperative to keep the html
tagging labels. These are using when training the model. 
This is still an ongoing project.
